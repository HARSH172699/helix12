            <p className='ff'>Working with Helix Tech was a refreshing experience. Before, my company struggled to find an IT professional that matched our needs. After describing the role we needed, Helixâ€™s team was able to provide us with a perfect-fit candidate who has since become one of our most valuable assets. I highly recommend Helix Tech no matter the size or age of your business. </p>
